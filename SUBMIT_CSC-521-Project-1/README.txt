- Tasks I-V
  We used the GMP library in C to complete the 
  follow tasks. 
  run "make" to create executable. 

- Task VI:
  We used compiled scans from scans.io of the Alexa Top 1 million 
  using RSA. We then used jq to pipe all the desired keys into 
  the file "keys.txt".

- Task VII:
  We used python libraries gmpy2 and multiprocessing. 
  Running the below command will display the times it takes
  to find the gcds of "keys.txt"
 
  run "python parallelize_gcd_keys.py"
